The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React is a shared dependency across all the files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used in all the .tsx files.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts. It is shared by all the files as it determines the packages that are available for use in the project.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for the TypeScript compiler. It is shared by all the .tsx files.

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is used to initialize pages. It has shared dependencies with all the pages in the application.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is used to augment the application's html and body tags. It has shared dependencies with all the pages in the application.

8. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are shared across all the pages in the application.

9. **favicon.ico**: This file is used as the website's icon and is shared across all the pages.

10. **.gitignore**: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It is shared by all the files in the project.

11. **README.md**: This file contains information about the project and is shared by all the files in the project.

Please note that the specific exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific implementation of the application and are not known at this stage.
